= Sample Recognizer Profiles

Each `.json` file in this directory represents a single technology profile that the recognizer can load. Use `ProjectRecognizer.fromProfilesDir(...)` with the path to a directory of profiles to assemble the recognizer at runtime.

Profiles follow this schema:

* `name` (required) – Display name for the stack card.
* `description` (optional) – Short human-friendly summary.
* `parent` (optional) – Name of the parent tech profile. Hierarchies allow the UI to highlight child stacks (e.g. React under Node.js, FastAPI under Python).
* `allOfFiles` / `anyOfFiles` / `excludedFiles` (optional arrays) – Glob patterns used to match relevant files.
* `keywords` (optional array) – Strings to locate in project files for additional confirmation.
* `manifests` (optional array) – Dependency manifest checks.

Each manifest entry supports:

* `pathPattern` (required) – Glob targeting manifest files within the project.
* `format` (optional, defaults to `text`) – Either `text` or `json`.
* `required` / `anyOf` (optional arrays) – Dependency names that must appear.
* `dependencyFields` (JSON manifests only) – Fields that contain dependency objects.

Add, remove, or edit profile files to customise the recognizer for your workspace.
