== Why Does This Documentation Exist?

[quote, A frustrated developer]
____
How much does the typical programmer know about the overall tooling they use — from Git's intricacies and configuration, to GitHub CI/CD, to GitLab CI/CD, to package manager implementation details? I feel like I'm constantly learning and relearning all of these config settings in an effort to master it.
____

The honest answer: **most programmers operate on a "good enough to unblock myself" level** with most of their tooling.

=== The Knowledge Distribution

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Level | ~% of Devs | What it looks like

| Copy-paste survivor
| 40%
| Googles error messages, copies Stack Overflow answers, doesn't know _why_ it works

| Functional user
| 40%
| Knows common commands, has a mental model that's 60% accurate, can troubleshoot basics

| Confident practitioner
| 15%
| Understands the underlying model, can configure from scratch, teaches others

| Deep expert
| 5%
| Reads source code, knows edge cases, writes the Stack Overflow answers

=== Why This Happens

. **The surface area is insane.** Git alone has 150+ commands. Then there's GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes, npm/pnpm/yarn, pip/uv/poetry, cargo, webpack/vite/esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript config, shell scripting, SSH, GPG... Nobody masters all of it.

. **The docs assume prior knowledge.** Git's man pages are famously written for people who already understand Git. Most tooling docs explain _what_ without explaining _why_ or _when_.

. **Tribal knowledge dominates.** Teams pass down incantations. "Just run this script." "Copy this CI file." The _why_ gets lost.

. **It's not rewarded.** Shipping features gets you promoted. Understanding `core.autocrlf` doesn't. So people rationally optimize for output, not depth.

. **Teachers often don't know either.** Academia lags industry by 5-10 years. Many CS professors have never used CI/CD professionally.

=== The Uncomfortable Truth

Most production software runs on configurations that _someone_ copy-pasted from a blog post years ago, nobody fully understands anymore, and everyone's afraid to touch. It works, so nobody questions it.

=== The Purpose of This Knowledge Base

This documentation exists to bridge the gap — to provide the reference material that _should_ exist but doesn't, because the people who understand tooling deeply rarely document it, and the people who document it rarely understand it deeply.

If you're bothered by not understanding your tools — if you want to _master_ your tooling rather than just survive it — you're in the right place.
