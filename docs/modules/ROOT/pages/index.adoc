= Dev Center

Welcome to the Dev Center documentation.

Dev Center is a developer tooling application that provides:

* Developer tooling setup
* Workflow management
* Software project management
* Environment management

== Templates & Standardization

Dev Center integrates tightly with the link:https://the-dev-center.github.io/templates/[Standard Project Templates] library. It acts as the local engine for:

* **Automatic Tech-Stack recognition**: Identifying the languages and frameworks used in your projects.
* **Template Installation**: One-click setup for standardized `.vscode` settings and workspace configurations.
* **Update Management**: Keeping your project configurations in sync with organization-wide standards.
