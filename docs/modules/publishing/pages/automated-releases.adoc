= Automated Releases with GitHub Actions
:navtitle: Automated Releases

GitHub can automatically build your releases and attach binaries. This saves you from manually compiling and uploading files.

== Is it Expensive?
**No, it is usually free.**

*   **Public Repositories**: GitHub Actions is **completely free**.
*   **Private Repositories**: You get 2,000 free minutes per month (Pro plan gets 3,000+).
    *   Building a D project takes ~2-5 minutes.
    *   You could build hundreds of releases per month without paying a cent.

== How to Automate Release Builds

You need a workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.

This workflow will:
1.  Trigger when you push a tag starting with `v` (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
2.  Spin up a runner (Linux, Windows, macOS).
3.  Install the D compiler (LDC recommended for release builds).
4.  Build your project.
5.  Upload the binary to the GitHub Release page automatically.

=== Example Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

[source,yaml]
----
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Trigger on tags like v1.0.0

permissions:
  contents: write # Required to create releases

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            artifact_name: msi-generator
            asset_name: msi-generator-linux-amd64
          - os: windows-latest
            artifact_name: msi-generator.exe
            asset_name: msi-generator-windows-amd64.exe
          - os: macos-latest
            artifact_name: msi-generator
            asset_name: msi-generator-macos-amd64

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install D compiler
        uses: dlang-community/setup-dlang@v1
        with:
          compiler: ldc-latest

      - name: Build
        run: dub build --build=release --config=prod # Use your prod config!

      - name: Upload binaries to release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          files: ${{ matrix.artifact_name }}
          name: ${{ github.ref_name }} # e.g. v0.1.0
          body: "Automated release build."
          draft: false
          prerelease: false

== Key Takeaway
By adding this file, you turn your "Source Ready" project into a "Binary Ready" project automatically every time you push a tag.
