= Antora Deployment Strategies: Root vs. Docs
:navtitle: Antora Deployment

When documenting a single repository, there are two common ways to structure your Antora project: the **Root Strategy** and the **Subfolder Strategy**.

Both work, but they have different trade-offs for local development and CI/CD.

== 1. The Root Strategy (Recommended)

In this setup, the `antora-playbook.yml` lives at the **repository root**, even if the content is in `docs/`.

*   **Structure**:
    ```text
    my-repo/
    ├── antora-playbook.yml  <-- Root
    ├── .github/workflows/docs.yml
    └── docs/
        └── antora.yml
    ```
*   **Playbook Config**:
    ```yaml
    content:
      sources:
        - url: .            # Points to the root (current dir)
          start_path: docs  # Tells Antora to look inside docs/
    ```
*   **Pros**:
    *   **CI Simplicity**: In GitHub Actions, the checkout root is `.` . The command `antora antora-playbook.yml` just works. No path overrides needed.
    *   **Clarity**: The playbook clearly defines the site for the *entire repo*.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Adds one file to your root directory.

== 2. The Subfolder Strategy (Legacy)

In this setup, everything lives inside `docs/`, including the playbook.

*   **Structure**:
    ```text
    my-repo/
    └── docs/
        ├── antora-playbook.yml  <-- Inside docs/
        └── antora.yml
    ```
*   **Playbook Config**:
    ```yaml
    content:
      sources:
        - url: ..           # MUST point to parent (git root)
          start_path: docs
    ```
*   **Pros**:
    *   Keeps the repository root clean.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **CI Complexity**: When running in CI, you are usually at the repo root.
        Running `antora docs/antora-playbook.yml` causes relative path resolution specific to where the command is *run* vs where the file *is*.
        *   If `url: .`, Antora thinks the git root is `docs/` (Wrong).
        *   If `url: ..`, Antora tries to resolve the parent of the checkout (Restricted).
    *   **Fix**: You often have to force correct paths with `--url .` CLI flags.

== Recommendation

**Use the Root Strategy.**

It aligns with how CI systems view your repository (as a unit). The slight "clutter" of one file at the root is worth the stability in deployment pipelines.

== GitHub Pages Configuration

Regardless of strategy, deployment is the same:

1.  **Build**: Antora generates a static site (default: `build/site` or `public/`).
2.  **Upload**: Upload this folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
3.  **Configure**: Set GitHub Pages to deploy from `gh-pages` / `root`.
