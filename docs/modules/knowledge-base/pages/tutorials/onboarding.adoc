= Developer Onboarding: Zero to One

This tutorial will guide you through setting up your development environment from scratch. Our goal is to get you from a fresh machine to your first successful code contribution.

== 1. Platform Setup (First Contact)
Before you can write code, you need a modern environment to work in.

1. Install **Windows Terminal** and **PowerShell 7** from the Microsoft Store.
2. Install **UniGetUI** to manage your software packages.
3. Enable **sudo for Windows** in your system settings.

== 2. Access (The Gate)
To interact with our repositories, you need a secure identity.

1. Generate a new SSH key using the recommended Ed25519 algorithm:
+
include::partial$ssh-keygen-ed25519.adoc[]

2. Start the SSH Agent service:
+
include::partial$ssh-agent-windows-start.adoc[]

3. Add your public key to your GitHub account settings.

== 3. Workflow (The Process)
With access granted, let's configure your local workflow.

1. Configure Git to handle line endings correctly (crucial for Windows users):
+
include::partial$git-autocrlf-input.adoc[]

2. Install **pnpm** globally:
+
[source,sh]
----
npm install -g pnpm
----

== 4. Runtimes (The Engine)
Install the execution engines required for our projects.

1. Install **Node.js (LTS)** via UniGetUI or the official installer.
2. Verify the installation:
+
[source,sh]
----
node --version
pnpm --version
----

== 5. Frameworks (The Work)
Most of our web projects use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

1. For a quick start in a static project, you can use the CDN:
+
include::partial$tailwind-cdn.adoc[]

2. For production projects, install it via the CLI:
+
include::partial$tailwind-cli-install.adoc[]

== 6. Sync (Persistence)
To maintain consistency across multiple machines, we use **Syncthing**.

1. Install **SyncTrayzor** (on Windows).
2. Configure your project folders to sync between your primary and secondary dev machines.

---

**Congratulations!** Your environment is now fully configured. You are ready to clone your first repository and start building.
