:navtitle: Architectural Principles

This document outlines the foundational philosophy and engineering standards for projects managed by the Dev Center. These principles prioritize performant architecture, intuitive user experience, and a tool-driven approach to engineering.

== 1. The Goal: Mastering Engineering Confusion
The Dev Center is a central hub for coding practices, knowledge, and standards. It exists to help both new and experienced engineers master the inherent confusion of software engineering by providing a unified interface for coordination.

== 2. Orientation: Investigation Over Documentation
Traditional "RTFM" (Read The F*cking Manual) strategies are often inefficient for rapid orientation.

* **Principle:** Orientation should be tool-based and investigative.
* **Practice:** Instead of forcing developers to read hundreds of pages of static docs, we build tools that provide setup, investigation, and contextual insights into the project architecture.

== 3. UI/UX: The "Nested Context" Problem
Modern IDEs and code editors have become cramped, slow, and unintuitive.

* **The Problem:** Developers keep stuffing features into a single UI because they lack a tool to coordinate concepts in a **nested context**.
* **Windowing Metaphor:** Host OS windowing metaphors (separating contexts into distinct windows) are underutilized. Separating contexts is essential for a clear mental model; ignoring this destroys UX.
* **Verdict:** Avoid "Web App Wrappers" (Electron) where native performance and OS-level windowing can provide a superior experience.

== 4. The Modern Web Stack
Performance and adoptability define our choice of web technologies.

=== SolidStart over Next.js
We recommend **SolidStart** (the Solid.js equivalent to Next.js) for new web-based projects.

* **Why:** React's Virtual DOM is a significant performance bottleneck. Solid.js uses fine-grained reactivity without a Virtual DOM, resulting in much faster updates.
* **The "Electron" Cost:** Web rendering engines and Electron are inherently slow. We must avoid putting too much processing responsibility on web technologies unless absolutely necessary.

=== WebAssembly (Wasm)
Wasm is the future of web-based processing. However, adoption is slowed by its current lack of direct DOM access. We favor Wasm for processing-heavy tasks but recognize its UI limitations in the current ecosystem.

== 5. AI & Ecosystem Maturity
When selecting a technology stack, consider the "AI Knowledge Gap."

* **Moving Targets:** Rapidly developing frameworks (e.g., Rust-based UI frameworks like **Leptos**) often suffer from "out-of-date code" issues when generated by AI.
* **Simplification:** If a framework's API changes too quickly for AI models to stay current, it adds significant friction to the development process. This is a primary reason we might favor more stable, well-documented reactive stacks (like Solid) over emerging Rust-wasm UI frameworks for immediate productivity.
