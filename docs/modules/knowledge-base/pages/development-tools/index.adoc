= Development Tools

We recommend these tools to improve your dev workflow:

* link:https://www.marticliment.com/unigetui/[UniGetUI] - A software package manager for Windows. It is a GUI for Microsoft's `winget` and other CLI package managers. Install subsequent apps with it, if possible.
* link:https://murmele.github.io/Gittyup/[Gittyup] - better Git UX than GitHub Desktop and VSCode source control. Alternatives: | link:https://rela.dev/[Rela.dev] | link:https://sourcegit-scm.github.io/[Sourcegit] | link:https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis[List of GitHub UI alternatives]
* link:https://cli.github.com/[GitHub CLI] - Official GitHub command-line interface. Lets you (or your AI) interact with GitHub from your terminal. Useful for initializing repositories locally then initializing them on github then syncing.

* link:https://github.com/masahide/OmniSSHAgent[OmniSSHAgent] - manages SSH agents on Windows. Having an SSH agent will allow you to commit to GitHub frequently without re-entering your SSH Key password for every commit. Windows's SSH agent sometimes doesn't play nice with VSCode.
* link:https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare[Windows Terminal] - Official Terminal rewrite from Microsoft. Load various shells in it, in a tabbed interface.
* link:https://www.warp.dev/[Warp] - A nice terminal with AI integrated. Even if you don't use the AI features, it provides a UX/UI upgrade over the traditional Terminal.
* link:https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mz1snwt0n5d?hl=en-US&gl=US[Powershell] (v7) - The modern Microsoft shell for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is the de-facto standard in VSCode (if installed).
* link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-settings/sudo/?wt.mc_id=windows_inproduct_sudo[`sudo` for Windows] - command line app to run elevated commands without memorizing Windows's stupid commands.
* VSCode alternatives - If you find a better editor, like IntelliJ, Lapce, or Zed, contact me, @AMDphreak, and let's see if we can get it added to the tutorial.
