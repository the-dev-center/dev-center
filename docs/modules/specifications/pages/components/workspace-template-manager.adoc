= Workspace Template Manager
:description: Specification for the module and code-workspace template management suite.

== Overview

The Workspace Template Manager is a core module of the Dev Center designed to simplify the management of VS Code extension suggestions, template files, and workspace settings across multiple repositories.

It provides a centralized suite for creating, maintaining, and syncing project configurations, ensuring consistency across projects while reducing manual maintenance overhead.

== Core Features

=== Template Creation
* Generate standardized template files for various tech stacks (Next.js, D, Python, etc.).
* Create base `.code-workspace` files with pre-configured settings and extension recommendations.

=== Settings Synchronization
* Sync settings from a central template repository to specific project repositories.
* Support for partial or full synchronization of:
** `*.code-workspace` files (Preferred for global standards to ensure precedence)
** `.vscode/settings.json` (Local overrides)
** `.vscode/extensions.json`
** Project-specific configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc`, `.hintrc`)

=== Repository Integration
* Apply templates to newly created repositories.
* Retroactively update existing repositories with new template standards.
* Detect and resolve configuration drift between repositories and their source templates.

== Usage Scenarios

. **New Project Onboarding:** A developer starts a new Next.js project. They use the Dev Center to apply the "Next.js Template," which automatically populates the repository with the correct `.vscode` settings and recommended extensions.
. **Global Standard Update:** A new "must-have" extension is added to the organization-wide standards. The Workspace Template Manager pushes this update to all relevant repositories' `.code-workspace` files.
. **Tech Stack Migration:** Moving a project from one set of standards to another (e.g., updating formatting rules) is handled via a guided sync process.

* [x] Define template schema for multi-stack support.
* [ ] Implement file copying and merging logic for JSON-based configurations.
* [x] Create a CLI or GUI interface within Dev Center for managing sync tasks.
* [ ] Integrate with GitHub API to automate template application during repo creation.

== Implementation Details

The manager is implemented as a set of D-language modules within the `dev_center` source tree:

* **`modules.template_installer.installer`**: Handles the local cache of the `templates` repository, performing Git-based updates with a 24-hour freshness check.
* **`modules.template_installer.project_manager`**: Bridges the template installer with the `ProjectRecognizer`. It enables stack-to-template mapping and the "Save as Template" functionality.
* **`DevCenterApp` (DlangUI)**: Orchestrates the user interface for browsing the template library and managing project-specific workspace configurations.
