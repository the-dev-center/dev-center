= Docs

Docs site uses Antora Docs. Docs are stored in .adoc (AsciiDoc) format in the `modules` directory.

In order to build the Antora site, see the instructions in link:site/README.adoc[].

== Structure

This directory contains two Antora configuration files with similar names but different purposes:

* `antora.yml` - Component descriptor (defines the component name, version, title, and navigation)
* `site/antora-playbook.yml` - Playbook (defines how to build the site, content sources, and output location)

The component descriptor (`antora.yml`) is used by Antora to understand the component structure, while the playbook (`site/antora-playbook.yml`) is used to build the documentation site.

== Module Organization

* **knowledge-base** - General reference material and best practices (not specific to dev-center)
* **specifications** - Dev-center app component and feature specifications
* **ROOT** - Project overview and vision

== Future Work

=== Knowledge Base: Git Documentation

The following Git documentation pages are placeholders and need content:

* [ ] `git/git-branching-strategies.adoc` - Git Flow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based development
* [ ] `git/git-hooks.adoc` - Pre-commit hooks, Husky, automation
* [ ] `git/git-large-files.adoc` - Git LFS setup and binary file handling
* [ ] `git/git-submodules.adoc` - Submodules, monorepo patterns, sparse checkouts
* [ ] `git/git-recovery.adoc` - Reflog, reset, recovering from mistakes

Each placeholder contains a checklist of topics to cover.
