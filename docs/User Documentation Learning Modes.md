# **User Documentation Modes and Cognitive States**

The transition from onboarding to logical mapping indicates a shift from skill acquisition to skill application. Beyond these two, user interaction with documentation is categorized by specific intent and cognitive requirements. The primary framework for this is the Diátaxis model, supplemented by the Five Moments of Need and Cognitive Processing theory.

### **The Diátaxis Model: Four Functional Modes**

The Diátaxis framework separates content into four distinct modes based on whether the user is at **study** (learning) or at **work** (acting), and whether they need **practical** instructions or **theoretical** knowledge.

* **Tutorials (Learning-Oriented):** The "onboarding" mode. It provides a guided, hands-on experience to build basic competence. It is pedagogical and linear.  
* **How-to Guides (Problem-Oriented):** Focused on a specific, real-world task. This is the mode for an "already-competent" user who has a goal but needs the recipe to execute it.  
* **Reference (Information-Oriented):** The "logical" path mentioned. It contains dry, technical facts (APIs, parameters, syntax). It is consulted by users who know what they are doing but need precise data points.  
* **Explanation (Understanding-Oriented):** Discursive and conceptual. It answers "why" rather than "how." It provides context, design philosophy, and architectural overviews to facilitate a deeper mental model.

### **The Five Moments of Need**

This model identifies the specific triggers that force a user back into documentation:

1. **New:** Learning a task for the first time (Tutorial).  
2. **More:** Expanding existing knowledge or exploring deeper features (Explanation).  
3. **Apply:** Executing a task in the moment of work (How-to).  
4. **Solve:** Troubleshooting when something breaks or an error occurs.  
5. **Change:** Adapting to updates, migrations, or architectural shifts in the system.

### **Cognitive Processing Modes**

Documentation also interfaces with the user's internal cognitive state:

* **Analytic Mode (System 2):** High cognitive load, focused on logical deduction, debugging, and parsing complex syntax. This is active when the user is in Reference or Explanation modes.  
* **Associative/Intuitive Mode (System 1):** Low cognitive load, relying on pattern recognition. Users enter this mode once the system's logic becomes "second nature," using documentation only for quick "refresher" cues.  
* **Exploratory Mode:** Divergent thinking where the user scans for possibilities without a specific goal. This mode requires discovery-focused documentation (feature lists and "What's possible" content).

### **Transition Summary Table**

| Mode | User Intent | Knowledge Type | Documentation Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Onboarding** | Acquisition | Practical | Tutorial |
| **Execution** | Application | Practical | How-to Guide |
| **Logic/Audit** | Retrieval | Theoretical | Reference |
| **Conceptual** | Comprehension | Theoretical | Explanation |
| **Crisis** | Correction | Practical | Troubleshooting |
